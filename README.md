For your first CS Build Week, you will be building an interactive Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) client and server in groups. To succeed with this project, you will be applying knowledge you've learned throughout the first part of CS to this project.

You should treat this like a real-world job assignment with your instructor as the client. Like in the real world, you may not be given all the information you need to complete the assignment up front. It is your responsibility to understand the requirements and ask questions if anything is unclear (UPER) before jumping into the code.

What is a MUD?
A MUD...is a multiplayer real-time virtual world, usually text-based. MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language. - Wikipedia

With the adventure game built in previous weeks, you have already created an application containing some of these elements (rooms, descriptions, objects, players, etc.). In this project, we will be expanding these worlds to be more interactive, provide new actions for players, display world info on a professional client site, and run the world's server on a hosted site to allow multi-player functionality.
